# Solace

A modern, feature-rich Twitch streaming platform built with Next.js 14, React 18, and Tailwind CSS. Experience Twitch like never before with enhanced chat, immersive viewing modes, and seamless authentication.

**Live Demo**: [solacestreams.vercel.app](https://solacestreams.vercel.app)

Built with love using Claude Code and vibe coding ‚ú®

## Quick start (local)
```bash
cp .env.example .env
npm install
npm run dev
# open http://localhost:3000
```

## Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file with the following variables:

```env
# Twitch API Credentials (Required)
# Get these from https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps
TWITCH_CLIENT_ID=your_twitch_client_id_here
TWITCH_CLIENT_SECRET=your_twitch_client_secret_here

# Site URL for OAuth and redirects (Required for production)
# This is used for OAuth redirect URIs and should match your deployed domain
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://solacestreams.vercel.app

# Twitch Player Parent Domains (Required)
# Comma-separated list of domains where the Twitch player can be embedded
NEXT_PUBLIC_TWITCH_PARENT=localhost,127.0.0.1,solacestreams.vercel.app

# Development HLS Source (Optional)
# Only needed for development/testing features
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEV_HLS_SRC=your_test_hls_stream_url
```

### Twitch App Configuration

1. Go to [Twitch Developer Console](https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps)
2. Create a new application or edit existing
3. Add OAuth Redirect URL: `https://your-domain.com/api/auth/twitch/callback`
4. Note your Client ID and Client Secret for the `.env` file

## Docker (production build)
```bash
docker compose up --build -d
# open http://localhost:8080
```

## Player Modes

The app includes two player modes:

- **Basic Mode**: Uses Twitch's iframe embed (more reliable, fewer features)
- **Enhanced Mode**: Uses Twitch's JavaScript SDK (more features, better control)

The player automatically falls back to Basic mode if Enhanced mode fails to load.

## Troubleshooting

### Player Issues
- **Blank player / CSP errors**: Ensure your domain is listed in `NEXT_PUBLIC_TWITCH_PARENT`
- **Enhanced mode not working**: Check browser console for CORS errors. Basic mode works without restrictions
- **iOS playback stuck**: Enhanced mode starts muted for autoplay compatibility. Use the "Unmute Stream" button
- **Player not loading**: Try switching between Basic and Enhanced modes using the toggle buttons

### Chat Issues
- **Can't send chat messages**: Set `TWITCH_CHAT_USERNAME` and `TWITCH_CHAT_OAUTH` in your `.env`
- **Chat not connecting**: Check your network connection and firewall settings

### General Issues
- **API errors**: Verify your Twitch API credentials are correct
- **Build errors**: Ensure all dependencies are installed with `npm install`
